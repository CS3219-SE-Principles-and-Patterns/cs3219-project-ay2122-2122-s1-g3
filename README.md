# Peerprep

## Databases used

1. MongoDB
2. Redis

## Microservices 
Here, we list the services hosted in our Kubernetes cluster

1. Frontend service
2. Compiler service
3. Editor service
4. Matchmaking service
5. User-management service
6. Video-chat service

** The MongoDB service is hosted remotely on Mongo itself, and thus we did not list the service above. We reach
it by accessing its endpoint directly from Mongo. 

## Docker image building

Docker images used in this project were built locally and pushed to DockerHub. As Docker 
has put up a paywall preventing triggered Docker Hub image builds from Github, we had
to instead build all our images locally and push them individually, from which they
could be pulled to AWS to join our EC2 cluster.
